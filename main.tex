\maketitle

When I was younger I played a lot of video games. Cheat codes were always there to make my playing much more enjoyable. The same feeling I had when I first started to use Laplace transfer, when dealing with differential equations, to one more time make my life easier. It really felt like life hack, but for long time I was not so sure where does the whole idea comes from.
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent One way to demystify the topic is to start with \textbf{power series}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:powerserie}
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots
\end{equation}\\
 \noindent To later the whole story becoming much more familiar, we will give generic name to the series as $A(x)$.\\

 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:markedps}
     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = A(x)
 \end{equation}\\

 \noindent As the $n \in \mathbb{N^+}$ and $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $n$ indexed parameter can be viewed as the discrete function $a(n)$ and equation (\ref{eq:powerserie}) becomes:\\
 
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:markedpss}
     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a(n) x^n = A(x)
 \end{equation}\\

\newpage

\noindent Now we can think of equation (\ref{eq:markedpss}) as associating discrete function of parameters of the power series to the sum of the power series, which can also be viewed as taking a discrete function defined for positive integers and converting it into continuous function.\\

\begin{equation}
    a(n) \rightarrow A(x)
\end{equation}
\\
Some examples of this could be, if we take as discrete function:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a(n) = 1$, left hand sight then becomes $1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...w$ and from \textit{Maclaurin Expansions} we can transform this power series to this exprassion $\frac{1}{1-x}$ with restricted domain to $|x| < 1$.

    \item $a(n) = \frac{1}{n!}$, power series is then $1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...$  and this expansion equals to well known $e^x$\\
    \\
\end{itemize}

Now, even though not motivated, let's do the continuous analog to the power series, where we are allowed to take every real value between and not only positive integers.\\
\begin{equation}
    n = 0,1,2,3,... \rightarrow t \in {0 \leq t < \infty}
\end{equation}\\

\noindent Summation then becomes integral over real numbers and $n$ in replaced with continuous variable $t$.\\ 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conti}
    \int_0^{\infty} a(t)x^t \, dt = A(x)
\end{equation}\\

\noindent Having $x$ as a base of the exponential is not so practical thing to have when solving the integration so we will make (\ref{eq:conti}) a bit more convenient with natural base $e$.

\begin{equation}
    x^t = e^{(ln(x))t}
\end{equation}\\

\noindent Also, we want to calculate this improper integral and in order to make it converging we have to restrict the $x$.\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:xrange}
    0 < x < 1 \rightarrow ln(x) < 0
\end{equation}

\newpage

Variable $ln(x)$ is not so aesthetic to have in equation so there comes infamous \textbf{s} in game! This substitution looks like:\\
\begin{equation}
    -s = ln(x)
\end{equation}\\

\noindent Minus on the left side is to always have \textbf{$s$} positive because of (\ref{eq:xrange}) and functions are mostly called $f(t)$ and not $a(t)$ so this will change too, just for the looks of it. After all this cosmetic changes we finally ends up with:\\

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:laplace}
    \int_0^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st} \, dt = F(s)
\end{equation}\\

\noindent This proposition (\ref{eq:laplace}), called \textbf{Laplace transform} is nothing more than a \textbf{continuous analog to the summation of the power series}. Which takes function defined for the positive real values of \textbf{t} and converts it into the function of variable \textbf{s}.
